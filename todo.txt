- Add locks so we dont have two processes calculating the same thing.
- Decide how to let store handle it's own expiry.
    It could understand the protocol (ie get/set a 2-tuple) and proxy that
    out to the proper methods. Using redis expireat after setting the value
    and then returning the ttl on access. If the object has a ttl we should
    use that instead.
- Function signature should be more aware of kwargs that override
  positions args.
