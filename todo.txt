- Decide how to delegate various functions to the store. If we assume that the
  store is constructed especially for this object then we can look for various
  methods and assume they are for us. We would want to look for:
	
	.set(key, value, expiry)
		key -> string
		value -> any
		expiry -> float
		
		This MUST store a tuple of (key, expiry).
	
	.ttl(key)
		key -> string
		return -> seconds that the key will remain alive for. This does not
			need to guarantee that the key will expire after that time.
